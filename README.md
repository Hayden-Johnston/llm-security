# Detect malicious requests
Prompt injection is number one of the top ten OWASP LLM security risks in 2026 and a concern for any inference provider. A successful prompt injection attempt puts client agentic systems at risk of data exposure or worse.
I built this as a drop-in pipeline to detect malicious prompts using deterministic rules alongside classifier models like Jev, Laya, and Clef.

# Benchmarking and training
The first phase of this project is testing different combinations of rules and classifiers for detection.  The goal is to detect 100% of malicious prompts while minimizing false positives.  To optimize the pipeline around this goal, open source datasets will be used alongside synthetic data from a variety of model families.  Beyond benchmarking, a future goal of this project is fine tuning local classifiers for security.  This will be explored once sufficient data has been gathered and validated.
